## ÔøΩ Troubleshooting

### File Path Issues (Fixed in v3.2.0)

If you encounter errors like `[Errno 22] Invalid argument` when generating reports, this has been resolved with enhanced file path sanitization:

**Error Example:**
```
Error: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'nycdoe_reports\\District_27\\Schools\\School_Q351\\Q351_bar_chart.html'
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced filename sanitization using regex pattern `r'[<>:"/\\|?*\n\r\t]'`
- Added automatic `.strip()` to remove problematic whitespace
- Implemented filename length limits (200 characters max)
- Added explicit directory creation before file operations
- Applied consistent sanitization across all report types

### District Sorting

Districts are now properly sorted numerically (D2, D3, ..., D11, D12) rather than alphabetically. This ensures logical ordering in all reports and navigation links.

### Performance Tips

- **Large Datasets**: For datasets over 100k records, consider increasing system memory
- **Network Drives**: Run from local drives for better I/O performance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+) recommended for optimal chart rendering

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Data Format**: Ensure CSV headers match expected column names
3. **Date Parsing**: Excel serial dates are automatically converted
4. **Memory Usage**: Close unused applications for large dataset processing
